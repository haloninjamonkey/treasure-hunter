    The Setup
As you begin working on a console game the basic requirements of any good console game will allow users to:

Move about a set of rooms
Get a description of the room they are in
Get Help ( show a list of all available commands )
Take Items
Give Up

To help you out with some of these basic features will notice that you already have some interfaces that have been built. 
These interfaces are designed to help ensure you implement the basic requirements of a console game.

Step 1 - Satisfy the Interfaces
To satisfy the interfaces you will need to ensure that your classes implement all of the features of the provided interfaces... 
You cannot remove anything from any of the interfaces. The Basic Features of the game:

Go <Direction> Moves the player from room to room
Take <ItemName> Places an item into the player inventory and removes it from the room
Look Prints the description of the room again
Inventory Prints the players inventory
Help Shows a list of commands and actions
Quit Quits the Game

Step 2 - Control the Game Loop
After building the game in the setup, you will need to continually take in user input. 
Make sure your game loop takes in the user input, handles it updating the game state (changing a room, taking an item, etc.) then takes in a new user command.

Because of how the interfaces are setup, you should be able to follow the pattern that has been laid out to build this functionality over several methods in the Game class.

Requirements
Functionality:
Player input must be seperated into either command or command and option

look - <command>
go north - <command> <option>
take key - <command> <option>
Players can move room to room with the go <direction> command

Items exist for the player to take from rooms

quit ends the game

At least 4 rooms and 1 takeable item

Players can lose the game due to a bad decision

The game is winnable

Visualization:
help Provides the user a list of commands for your game
look Re-prints the room description
inventory prints a list of the items in the players inventory
When the player enters a room they get the room description
Stretch Goals (Requirements first! Then stretch goals.)
Try changing the console color or adding some beeps for dramatic effect
Clear the console when appropriate
The user should know when its their turn try formatting the users input with something like this everytime its the users turn to type
What do you do: __________________ // <- Their Answer on the same line
Add some riddles or puzzles for users to solve to get from room to room
Lock some doors that users need keys to get through. */
